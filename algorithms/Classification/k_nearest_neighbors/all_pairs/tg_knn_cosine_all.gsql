    Maturity:
        Production

    Description: 
        This query is k-nearest neighbors based on Cosine Similarity on all vertices.
        The output is the predicted label for all the vertices depending on the majority label of their k-nearest neighbors.

        reverse_e_type_set:
            Reverse edge types to traverse
        weight_attribute:
            Edge attribute to use as the weight of the edge
        label:
            Vertex attribute to recognize as the label of the vertex
        top_k:
