    description: "This algorithm runs the single source version repeatedly using every vertex with a known label as the source vertex and predicts its label. It assesses the accuracy of the predictions for each value of k, and then repeats for different values of k in the given range.  The goal is to find the value of k with highest predicting accuracy in the given range, for that dataset."
    schema_constraints: "This algorithm requires a FLOAT attribute on the target edge types representing weight, and a STRING attribute representing the label."
